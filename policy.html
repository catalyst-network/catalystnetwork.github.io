                                for such purposes or if we intend to disclose your information to any third party for
                                such purposes. You can also exercise your data rights at any time by contacting us at
                                info@catalystnet.org. Our site may, from time to time, contain links to and from the

                            <li>Access to information
                                The Act gives you the right to access information held about you. Your right of access
                                can be exercised in accordance with the Act. Any access request
                                may be subject to a fee to meet our costs in providing you with details of the
                                information we hold about you.

                            <li>Remarketing
                                Why am I seeing ads by Google for page I’ve viewed? Our website uses a remarketing advertising service. Our remarketing service is provided by Google and other companies that show our ads on websites across the Internet. With remarketing, you may see ads for our website you have previously looked at. As an example: Suppose you visit a website that sells computers, but you do not buy a computer on your first visit to that website. The website owner might like to encourage you to revisit their site and buy a computer by showing you their ads again on other websites you visit. We use remarketing for similar purposes so you may see advertisements for our webinar/offers as you search the Internet. For this to happen, Google, or other remarketing providers will read a cookie that is already in your browser, or they place a cookie in your browser when you visit our site or other sites using remarketing. (This can only happen if your browser is set to let it happen).
                                If you do not wish to see ads from Catalyst Network, you can opt out:
								Opt out of Google’s use of cookies by visiting Google’s Ads Settings https://adssettings.google.com/authenticated.
