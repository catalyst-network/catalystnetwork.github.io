                                Visitor(s) may link to the Website provided the Visitor does so in a way that indicates

                                not constitute a waiver of such rights or provisions. If any provision of these Terms of

                                found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, the parties nevertheless agree
                                that the
                                court should endeavour to give effect to the parties’ intention as reflected in the
                                provision and
                                the other provisions of these Terms of Use shall remain in full force and effect.
